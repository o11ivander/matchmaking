Improve the previous function for squads management (group of friends playing together).
Now you receive a list of 1000 to 2000 entries (PlayerID, Skill, SquadId).

If SquadId is -1, Player doesnâ€™t belong to any Squad,
while all players with the same SquadId have to be in the same match, and the same team.
Modify the previous code.
